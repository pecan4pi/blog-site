<h1>Hacking is weird, society is even weirder (and quite awful)</h1>
<p>I don't know how to hack. Well, I sort of do, but I also don't. I know how BEeF works, sort of. I'm broke so I can't buy a server, and I have no clue how to host my own, so I can't use it to prank anyone. I know how to use linux terminal, but thats not hacking, even if anyone thinks it is.
Knowing how to code doesn't mean your a hacker, even if thats what people think. I'm making this website and people are impressed that I can do that, even if its not that impressive. I literally am using a html guide from the early 2000's! ANYONE CAN DO THIS!!! THEY CAN JUST SIGN UP FOR GITHUB, MAKE A FREE ACCOUNT AND UPLOAD IT!!!!! 
I just needed to rant for a while. My life is really stressful. I'm trying to fit in. I can't. I'm trying to keep up. I can't. I'm trying to enjoy my life, but everyone is trying to make me do what they want. Not giving a shit about my oppinions and feelings. I want to have free time, but I just can't, because I have to work. 
they train everyone to be a corperate slave, and anyone who doesn't want to gets punished. The ironic thing about life, is whenever you play video games, watch shows or read books, we enjoy it. your watching someones life, but when it comes to our own lives, we run away. we hide, become depressed, anxious, suicadal, scared, tired and irritable. 
the list goes on and on and on. It sucks. anyways, I think I'm done Writing now.</p>
