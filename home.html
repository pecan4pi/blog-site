<h1>Welcome to my blog website!</h1>
<p>My name is [redacted], but I usually go by @pecan4pi (recentlly changed from @pecan4) on the internet. This is my blog site where I occasionally might post some stuff. Its gonna be some pretty simple stuff because I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm coding this from scratch with html five and without javascript because I don't know anything about it with web design.</p>
